# Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes is predicted by employing proficient machine learning algorithms based on a local dataset (Jammu and Kashmir, India).The final model is a hybrid model with an increased accuracy and efficiency. )
feature scaling is done using min-max imputer .
In spot checking various machine learning algorithms are used for traning and testing , the dataset is divided into 70% for traning and 30% for testing.
In pridiction phase the final model is created and the model is tested on a random data series.
The project aims at comparing ML algorithms on a local dataset for diabetes prediction.
